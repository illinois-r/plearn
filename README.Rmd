The goal of `plearn` is to simplify working with the [PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl) 
platform by automating the creation of common questions.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/illinois-r/plearn) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("illinois-r/plearn")
```

## Development Status

Workflow with this package is highly experimental and is likely to be tuned over
the next school year. That said, using the templates in the package now with
PrairieLearn will likely be fine. However, these templates are using
PrairieLearn-specific markup, e.g `<pl-*></pl-*>` as part of the question creation procedure.
In the future, the package will likely move toward using
[`asciidoc`](http://asciidoc.org/) standard, which would allow questions to
be written agnostic to the PrairieLearn platform. This would defend against or
provide compatibility with a change from `v3` to `v4`. 

## Motivation

After working on [PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl) 
problems for awhile, I realized how much I would like to apply the 
[`usethis`](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis) package mentality for generating
questions. As a result, this package extends [`usethis`](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis)
where applicable into question and course creation.
